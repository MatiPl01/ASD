    "Naszym celem jest podział zbioru wartości, z którego mamy wyznaczyć medianę, na 2 podzbiory, z których jeden będzie zawierał wartości mniejsze od mediany, a drugi większe od mediany (mediana może należeć do jednego z nich - wyjaśnienie później). Na myśl nasuwa się posortowanie tablicy, ale nie o to chodzi w tym zadaniu, bo musimy zapewnić, że wstawianie do struktury zajmie czas $ O(log(n)) $ oraz odczyt mediany również $ O(log(n)) $. Przedstawione wymagania, dotyczące pożądanej złożoności obliczeniowej, sugerują nam od razu zastosowanie struktury, dla której operacja wstawiania i usuwania wartości ma złożoność $ O(log(n)) $, a więc skorzystanie z kopca binarnego. Ponieważ planujemy podział wartości na 2 (prawie) równe (mogą się różnić o 1 element) podzbiory, potrzebne nam będą 2 kopce. Najłatwiej osiągniemy pożądany efekt, budując nową strukturę w taki sposób, by korzystała zarówno z kopca Max Heap, jak i Min Heap."

    "Przejdźmy teraz do omówienia, jaka jest logika dzialania tego algorytmu. Ponieważ Max Heap umieszcza wartość największą w swoim korzeniu, a Min Heap wartość najmniejszą, Max Heap musi zawierać tę połowę (lub blisko połowę) wartości, które są mniejsze od mediany (oraz ewentualnie również medianę), a Min Heap - wartości od niej większe (lub również medianę, jeżeli nie ma jej w Max Heapie)."

    "Tworzenie struktury zajmie czas $ O(n \\cdot log(n)) $. Postępujemy tak, że przeprowadzamy iterację przez sekwencję wartości, podejmując decyzję, do którego kopca \"wrzucić\" bieżącą wartość. Ponieważ założyliśmy, że kopiec Min Heap ma wartości większe, jeżeli bieżąca wartość jest większa od wartości najmniejszej w Min Heapie, musimy bieżącą wartość wrzucić do Min Heapa, natomiast, w przeciwnym wypadku, wartość wrzucamy do Max Heapa (ponieważ jest mniejsza od najmniejszej wartości spośród wartości największych (około połowy wartości)). Po każdym takim wstawieniu konieczne jest sprawdzenie, czy nasza struktura jest nadal zbalansowana (czy różnica między liczbą elementów w Min Heapie a liczbą elementów w Max Heapie jest nie większa niż 1). Jeżeli okaże się, że jest niezbalansowana, musimy z większego obecnie kopca zabrać roota i przerzucić do drugiego kopca (oczywiście taka operacja wymaga zbalansowania obu kopców, dlatego najlepiej posłużyć się wcześniej poznaną implementacją strkuktury kopca)."
